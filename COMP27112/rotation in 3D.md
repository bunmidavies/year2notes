[[COMP27112]] - [[geometrical transformations]]

- rotation of a point about the origin in 3D is the same as [[rotation in 2D]] in the XY plane, and Z remains unchanged:

- therefore, given a point $(x,y,z)$, rotating it by $\theta$ around the origin gives
$$(xcos\theta - ysin\theta,xsin\theta + ycos\theta, z)$$

- ==3D rotations are typically relative to a certain axis, i.e. about the Z axis==

- but 3D rotations can also be about an arbitrary axis vector
