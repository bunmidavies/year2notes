- there are two main types of light sensitive cells in the eye - there are also subtypes of these types:
	- ==rods== for low-light vision, no colour
	- ==cones== for colour - 65% of cones are sensitive to red light, while 33% are sensitive to green light, and 2% are sensitive to blue light (but are the most sensitive)

### types of cone
- S cone: sensitive to short wavelength visible light (roughly ==blue==)
- M cone: sensitive to medium wavelength visible light (roughly ==green==)
- L cone: sensitive to long wavelength visible light (roughly ==red==)

### pigments vs lights
- the primary colours for pigments (e.g. paints) are different to the primary colours for light

- the human eye will see that a green object is green, due to white light from the sun illuminating the object, the object reflecting green light and absorbing all other colours, and the eye's green cones detecting this green light
