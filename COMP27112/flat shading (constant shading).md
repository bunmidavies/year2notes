- flat shading is the simplest approach to shading a surface
- it involves taking a local illumination model ([[illumination]]), one of the vertices of a polygon, and compute the surface normal for that vertex
- the local illumination model then computes the colour for that vertex, and that colour is applied to every pixel in the polygon
