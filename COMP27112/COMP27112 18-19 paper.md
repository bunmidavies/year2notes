- N represents surface normal, i.e. vector orthogonal to the surface
- R represents the vector with the max specular reflection
- V represents the vector facing the viewer, i.e. the reflection which is actually seen
- to estimate specular reflection, the angle between R and V is a factor, and typically fresnels equation is used to approximate the resultant intensity which reaches the viewer
- $\frac{I_p}{d'} \cdot k_s \cdot (\hat{R} \cdot \hat{V})^n$
- where n is a constant used between 0-200
- $k_s$ is the specular reflection coefficient, between 0-1
- $I_p$ is the intensity from the light source, and $d'$ is used to provide an approximation of the incident intensity based on how far away the light source is (lamberts law approximation)
