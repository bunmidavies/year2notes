### aperture
- a camera must vary the amount of light which it takes in, in order to be able to take clear photos in different environments - for instance on both a sunny day and in a dimly lit room
- one way the camera does this is through varying ==aperture size== - different sizes will allow different amounts of light in, similar to how an eyes pupil will dilate and constrict

- cameras can also have the option of an exposure 'lock' - this essentially makes the camera remember what the exposure was like for some object, which can cause other objects in the scene to have too much / too little exposure

### HDR
 - ==HDR== = high dynamic range - this tries to solve the problem of one object in a scene having the right exposure while the other doesn't - this can be simulated by cutting out objects from one image, and pasting them into another image
 - cameras which do this typically take a number of shots in quick succession, at different exposure levels (bracketing), and combines them
 - cameras can also use CMOS camera sensors, which have a higher range of colours - 12 bits per channel (thus 4096 levels rather than 256)
 - certain file formats already handle up to 16-bit channels - TIFF, PNG, JPEG2000, as well as the HDMI standard ([[image file formats + colour]])
 - 16-bits per channel is also known as ==deep colour==


### shutter speed / exposure time
- another way is to change the amount of time that the ==camera shutter== remains open - this alters the amount of light that arrives at the sensor - this is also known as ==shutter speed==
- when you hear an SLR camera click, that is the shutter opening and closing (more technically the mirror within the camera moving) - for long exposure pictures, the time between clicks will increase

- the faster the shutter speed, the lower the exposure time
