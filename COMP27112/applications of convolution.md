[[COMP27112]] - [[convolution]]

### smoothing
- convolution is able to smooth out images by ==reducing noise== in an image, since it takes the average of its neighbouring pixels
- the bigger the kernel / filter, the more blurred the image actually becomes

### sharpening
- sharpening is essentially the opposite of smoothing - it enhances discontinuities but ==amplifies noise==
