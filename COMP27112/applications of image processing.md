- basically, anything that can generate a ==spatially coherent measurement of some property== - can be imaged. This means many different energy sources can be imaged, e.g.
	- electromagnetic (gamma rays, x rays, visible light, microwaves, radio waves)
	- sound waves
	- magnetic fields
- this results in image processing being applied in many fields, including:
	- medicine
	- oil exploration
	- astronomy
	- weather
	- agriculture
	- policing/security
	- satellite imagery/orthophotography (detecting coastal erosion)
	- archaeology
	- beauty industry

### gamma rays vs x-rays
- gamma rays are used frequently in medical applications for imaging - for instance a patient can consume radio-pharmaceuticals, and radioactive material is then absorbed by the body and the emitted rays can be detected and imaged
- this differs to an x-ray, where radiation passes through the body, rather than being detected

### infrared
- infrared can detect body heat, finding itself useful in applications like airport security, as well as river/coastline detection

### microwave/radar
- radio waves are transmitted, and detected once reflected back - the time taken for the signal to reach a surface and reflect back can be used to calculate how far away this surface is from the detector

### Lidar
- lidar = ==light detection and ranging==
- it basically follows the same idea as radar, but uses ==light== instead of radio waves

### ultrasound/sonar
- again following the idea of emitting waves and using the reflection of these waves to produce images, ultrasound detectors emit soundwaves and detect the reflection time to generate images
- sonar is the same idea as ultrasound, but is typically used in submarines
