[[COMP27112]]

- peoples monitors/screens have different settings, meaning that it is possible to see one colour on your screen, send it to someone else and they'll basically see a different colour
- in an attempt to standardise the colours that certain codes represent (?), the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (International Commision on Illumination) created a standard colour space in 1931

| Colour | Wavelength (nm) |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Blue   | 435.8           |
| Green  | 546.1           |
| Red    | 700.0                |

- the possible colours that can be created with the standard can be represented with this diagram - these are known as [[perceptual spaces]]

- other standards also exist (e.g. YCrCb for broadcasting, HSV, IHS, HSB, Lab)
- these colours don't perfectly match with the wavelengths perceived by cone cells in [[the human eye]], since that info wasnt available in 1931
- the amounts of red, green and blue are called the ==tristimulus values==, denoted by X, Y and Z
- these can then be normalised so that the ratios can add to 1, and so z can be calculated with x and y alone
