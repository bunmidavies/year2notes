- IHS stands for ==intensity==, ==hue== and ==saturation== - it is a colour model, used to represent colours by separating them into 3 main components:
	1. Intensity - brightness. Also the weighted average of RGB
	2. Hue - the basic colour. An angle from 0 to 359
	3. Saturation - the depth of colour. Lower saturation = more white
- IHS is able to represent colours just like RGB can, but they typically have different uses in the real world
- this means that its possible to convert to/from RGB <-> IHS
