### diffuse reflection
- diffuse reflection is absorption and uniform reradiation - some wavelengths are absorbed, and some will be reflected
- e.g. a green object looks green because it only reflects green. An incident light ray hits the surface of the object, and gets reflected in all directions

### specular reflection
- specular reflection is reflection at the air/surface interface - to a first approximation, the colour of the specular reflection is the same as the light source (when in reality the colours aren't exactly equal)
- there are ==perfect== and ==imperfect== specular reflections
- perfect = where the angle between the reflected ray of light and normal is equal to the angle between the incident ray and surface normal (and light is completely reflected)
- imperfect = some light rays will get bounced off at 'incorrect' angles, mainly due to a rough surface which the incident ray hits
