Rotation : ==positive rotations are anticlockwise==

R is the magnitude, while different angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ give $x,x',y$ and $y'$ - and these can be simplified to give the equations in the pink. Since the magnitude of the point does not change, and only the angle does, you define the rotation using the same magnitude just at a different angle

Rotation can also be performed ==about a point==
