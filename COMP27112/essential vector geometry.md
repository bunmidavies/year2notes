- vector addition - pretty straightforward, can't perform on two vectors of different dimensions. ==Do not add the homogeneous component==
- vector subtraction - same as addition, except subtraction. Represents a line between two points

- multiplication by a scalar - again, all components apart from $w$ are multiplied

- vector magnitude simply involves square rooting the squares of all dimensions - this represents ==distance==

- [[vector normalisation]]

- ==dot product== = inner product, which returns a scalar (multiply each corresponding dimension by eachother, and sum them all)

- ==cross product== = outer product, gives a vector (==not asked to remember==)
