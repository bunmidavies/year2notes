#### addition / subtraction
- vector addition - pretty straightforward, can't perform on two vectors of different dimensions. ==Do not add the homogeneous component==
- vector subtraction - same as addition, except subtraction. Represents a line between two points

#### multiplication
- multiplication by a scalar - again, all components apart from $w$ are multiplied

#### magnitude
- vector magnitude simply involves square rooting the squares of all dimensions - this represents ==distance==

#### normalisation
- [[vector normalisation]]


#### dot product / inner product
- ==dot product== = inner product, which returns a scalar (multiply each corresponding dimension by eachother, and sum them all)

#### cross product
- ==cross product== = outer product, gives a vector which is perpendicular to the two vectors
- we are not asked to remember the definition
