                var camera, scene, renderer;

                scene = new THREE.Scene();

                camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
                /*  QUESTION 1
                    PerspectiveCamera function arguments:
                    1st argument is FOV i.e. field of view, the number of degrees of the scene which can be scene from the camera
                    increasing the FOV is like increasing the degrees the camera can see - for context, most humans have an fov of about 180
                    some bird eyes have an FOV of 360 degrees, meaning they can see all around them 
                    ---

                    2nd argument is aspect ratio of the camera, by using window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight we just get the ratio of the whole window
                    by increasing the aspect ratio, things will be stretched in the y axis
                    for instance adding 1000 to the aspect ratio starts to make the cube look like a tall building
                    because overflow is set to hidden as well, it means the scene will take up more space than is available in our window, so the cube may not fully appear in the scene
                    ---

                    3rd argument is 'near', the minimum distance from the camera that threejs renders the scene from
                    the greater the near, the further away objects have to be at a minimum to be rendered
                    for instance if we set near to 10, the cube would disappear as it becomes too close
                    ---

                    4th argument is 'far', the max distance we can see the scene from the camera - objects outside of this distance may not get rendered
                    it is essentially opposite to far, where the greater far is, the more further away objects can be and still be rendered
                    however, a very high far can cause rendering issues    
                    setting far to 1 stops the cube from rendering,

                camera.position.z = 12;
                /*  QUESTION 2
                    camera.position.z defines the z coordinate of the camera
                    in three js a camera looks down its local, negative z axis
                    this means when the camera position is 5, its looking at objects going in the direction where z is 0
                    therefore increasing camera.position.z makes the cube look farther away
                    and decreasing camera.position.z makes the camera closer to the cube, causing it to appear bigger
                    so camera.position.z = 50 would make the cube look very far away
                    camera.position.z = -5 puts the camera in front of the cube
                    and camera.position = 0 basically puts you inside the cube (?)

                renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
                /*  QUESTION 3
                    renderer.setSize makes the output canvas to the given width and height
                    it also takes into account the previously declared aspect ratio, and sets the viewport to the required size
                    for this reason, it means that even if we made setSize very small e.g. (50, 50), the cube will still appear, but be very small
                    changing the width and height just changes how big the actual outputted canvas on the HTML page is, without affecting what the camera can/cant see

                    the 3 arguments in the BoxGeometry constructor are:
                    - width (X axis)
                    - height (Y axis)
                    - depth (Z axis)
                    that means when all of these are equal, a cube will be created, and increasing these all makes a bigger cube
                    when the arguments are different to eachother, a cuboid is formed
                    
                    in this app, increasing the width makes the cuboid wider (in the sense that it reaches closer to the edges of your screen)
                    increasing the height makes the cuboid taller
                    and increasing the z makes the cuboid look as if it is reaching closer to the camera
