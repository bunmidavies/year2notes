# part 2 - image processing
*Image processing - A set of computational techniques for analysing, enhancing, compressing and reconstructing images. It's main components are importing, in which an image is captured through scanning or digital photograph; analysis and manipulation of the image, accomplished using various specialised software applications; and output (e.g. to a printer or monitor).*
