# part 2 - image processing
*Image processing - A set of computational techniques for analysing, enhancing, compressing and reconstructing images. It's main components are importing, in which an image is captured through scanning or digital photograph; analysis and manipulation of the image, accomplished using various specialised software applications; and output (e.g. to a printer or monitor).*

### week 6
*lecture 1*
- [[image representation]]
- [[point processing]]
- intro to [[openCV]]
*lecture 2*
- [[the human eye]]
- [[standard colour frequencies]]
- [[perpetual spaces]]
- [[IHS]]

### week 7
*lecture 3*
- [[applications of image processing]]
- [[history of image processing]]
- [[spatial resolution]]
- [[nyquists theorem]]

*lecture 4*
- [[image histograms]]
- [[thresholding]]
- [[geometrical transformations]] (image processing) + lens distortion demos
