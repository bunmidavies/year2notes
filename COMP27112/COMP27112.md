# visual computing

### content

part 1 = converting from an application program scene to a view on screen
### week 1
- [[history of computer graphics]]
- three.js is a wrapper for webGL, which is a web based implementation of [[openGL]]

### week 2
- [[coordinates and vectors]]
- [[geometrical transformations]]
- [[composing transformations]]
- [[transformations in openGL]]
- [[essential vector geometry]]
- lecture 4 - [[shaders]]

### week 3
- [[polygons + polygon soup + mesh]]
- [[surface normal vector]]
- [[tessellation]]
- [[viewing pipeline]] (going from the model to the display + hidden surface removal)

### live lecture 3rd feb
- course is split into two main parts:
	- computer graphics (synthetic)
	- image processing (analytical)
- [[three.js]]
non exhaustive list of topics the 2 parts cover
- visualisation uses
- simple illumination equation
- point processing techniques (increasing brightness, image negative)
- applications of image processing (i.e. medical imaging, forensics)
- geometrical transformations
- image noise + noise reduction
- edge operators + edge detection + hough transform
- component analysis
- image compression
- openCV ins C/C++
- camera exposure
