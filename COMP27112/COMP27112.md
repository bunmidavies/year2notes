### live lecture 3rd feb
- course is split into two main parts:
	- computer graphics (synthetic)
	- image processing (analytical)
- [[three.js]]
non exhaustive list of topics the 2 parts cover
- visualisation uses
- simple illumination equation
- point processing techniques (increasing brightness, image negative)
- applications of image processing (i.e. medical imaging, forensics)
- geometrical transformations
- image noise + noise reduction
- edge operators + edge detection + hough transform
- component analysis
- image compression
- openCV ins C/C++
- camera exposure
