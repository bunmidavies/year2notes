[[COMP27112]] - [[openGL]]

In the programmable graphics pipeline, there are still fixed processes that are applied to 3D vertices, but there are two extra processes which the programmer has to implement themselves, the ==vertex shader== and ==fragment shader== 

- note that extra processes like 'geometry' and [[tessellation]] also exist
