[[COMP27112]]

both parts of the course have some section on geometrical transformations, so theyre both just kept here

### part 1
- Translation : moving in the x, y or z axis
- Scaling : multiplying the dimensions of an object - [[matrices for scaling]]
- [[rotation in 2D]]
- [[rotation in 3D]] 
- [[matrices for rotation]]
- [[homogeneous coordinates]]

### part 2
- scaling, translation, and scaling + translation involve the same ideas from part 1

- shearing
