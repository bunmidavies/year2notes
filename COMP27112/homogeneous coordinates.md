[[COMP27112]] - [[geometrical transformations]]

- it is not possible to translate a column vector by simply multiplying it by a 3x3 matrix 
- to solve this problem, ==homogeneous coordinates== can be used, which introduce an additional dimension
- translation now becomes possible by kind of combining the identity matrix with the required translations

- Homogeneous coordinates allow the ability to use a ==consistent== matrix representation for all kinds of linear transformations 
- $(w,x,y,z)$ itself where $w$ = 1, are the actual homogeneous coordinates
