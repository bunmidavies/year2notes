The first computer graphics device was the Whirlwind (1951) - the ==CRT== (Cathode Ray Tube) displayed the outputs, and a bunch of inputs were used, including a ==lightpen==

The main problem with the CRT display was to do with ==persistence== - drawing something on the CRT wouldn't keep it there forever, it would rapidly fade instead. The solution for this were ==refresh rates==

The next major development was in 1964, when the mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart - mice didn't become widely used until the 70s/80s though

Raster graphics displays were the next big advancement - this is where a 2d array of pixels are used. This means in order to display images with raster graphics, these images needed to be sampled (and the more samples, the better the image / the better the fidelity).

Note that raster graphics are ==always an approximation== of the real thing, and this leads onto the more general point

==In computer graphics, everything is an approximation==

Shading within computer graphics was first invented by Henri Gouraud, in 1970

Xerox - one of the first GUIs - was invented in 1973, with a resolution of 606x808

Apples first computer with a complete GUI was in 1983 (Lisa, $9,995) - around this time, vector games consoles started becoming popular (pong, space invaders)
