[[COMP23311]] `week 4`

==Cost estimation== in software involves the allocation of 3 things:
- Effort
- Resources
- Schedule

The main technique for accurate time estimates in COMP23311 is ==Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)==

WBS involves breaking down some task into ==subtasks==, with each subtask taking up some % of the whole task

There are a number of factors which make estimating ==difficult==:
- unfamiliar codebase
- unaware of colleague abilities
- unfamiliar with the task at hand, not sure how it can be divided into subtasks

A ==chaos report== shows what % of projects within companies of different sizes are considered ==successful==:
- Large companies: 9%
- Medium companies: 16%
- Small companies: 28%

Reasons for projects being considered 'unsuccessful' or a failure include:
- Cost overruns
- Time overruns
- Content deficiencies
A lot of the time, the estimations for cost/time didn't match reality

Around ==half== of IT executives today think that there are more project failures now than there used to be

==Example WBS==
You need to fix a bug related to players losing HP at certain times of the day in Stendhal - this is 100% of your task and could be broken down into the following:
1. Replicate the bug (20%)
2. Fix the bug (20%)
3. Check that the bug is really fixed (20%)
4. Push the bug fix to repo (20%)
5. Make sure bug doesn't exist elsewhere (20%)

These can also be broken down into smaller subtasks, and they do not have to be split evenly
