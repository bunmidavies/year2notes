[[COMP26020]]

C++ started as C with classes, and is a straightforward extension of C (hence the **++**), started by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985

There are 3 main eras describing the advancements C++ made from C:
	- 80s: pre-standard C++ (C with classes)
	- 90s/00s: C++98 (Templates + Template Library)
	- 2011: C++11 (Functional, Type safety, threading, simpler syntax etc.)

Why use C++?
	- C++ thrives to be ==pragmatic and fast== - elegance and low latency is common within C++, and C++ aims to provide static type safety through determining things at compilation time, rather than runtime
	- ==RAII - Resource Allocation Is Initialisation==. Resource allocation is automated through the compiler - this allows certain operations which may be complicated, to be done easily with some sense of abstraction

==Why not use C++==?
	- C++ can be more complex than other languages, as well as dangerous due to the ability it gives to its users to misuse certain functions
	- There are many many syntax / library approaches within C++, which again allows for more unintentional misuse
	- ==No garbage collection== - C++ is notorious for memory bugs and the amount of money that big corporations have probably lost through some C++ memory bug
