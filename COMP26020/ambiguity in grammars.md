[[COMP26020]]

any of the following can hold in order for a grammar to be ambiguous:
- a grammar that produces more than one parse tree for some sentence is ==ambiguous==
- if a grammar has more than one leftmost derivation for a single sentential form, the grammar is ==ambiguous==
- if a grammar has more than one rightmost derivation for a single sentential form, the grammar is ==ambiguous==

the solution to ambiguity is to rewrite the grammar
