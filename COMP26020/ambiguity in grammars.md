[[COMP26020]]

any of the following can hold in order for a grammar to be ambiguous:
- a grammar that produces more than one parse tree for some sentence is ==ambiguous==
- a grammar has more than one leftmost/rightmost derivation for a single sentential form, the grammar is ==ambiguous==

ambiguity in grammars for programming languages becomes a problem when doing [[syntax analysis]]

==the main solution when facing an ambiguous grammar is to rewrite the grammar==
