1. phrases structure
2. context sensitive (number of left hand side symbols $\leq$ number of rh side symbols)
3. context-free (used for [[syntax analysis]])
4. regular (used for [[lexical analysis]]) - only rules of the form: $A\rightarrow\varepsilon$, $A\rightarrow a$, $A\rightarrow pB$ are allowed

therefore regular languages are a subset of context-free languages, which are a subset of context sensitive languages, which are a subset of phrase structured
