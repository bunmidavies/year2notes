### `argc` / `argv`
- `main` in C can take two parameters which denote the number of command line arguments, and what those command line arguments are
- the first argument for a program will always be the name of the program
- `argc` denotes how many arguments there are (including program name)
- `argv` is an array of strings, storing what those arguments actually are
