[[COMP26020]] - [[C]]

### conditionals
- in C, ==false = 0==, and ==true = everything but 0==
- operator precedence in C is: `!` first, then `&&`, then `||`

### switch statements
- switch cases can be used to avoid a bunch of if-elses
- use `break` to avoid falling through into cases below after executing code from a specific case
- the `default` path is taken when no other case matches
