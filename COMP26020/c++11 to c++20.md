[[COMP26020]]

- the transition to modern c++ has seen a lot of huge changes:
	- modules / concepts
	- threading support has been improved (but out of scope for comp26020)

- below, a subset of these changes which are more likely to be encountered will be discussed
	- `NULL` is bad as it is simply a compiler directive - it can break down when doing comparisons, and **be redefined**
	- `auto` - kind of self explanatory
	- tuples and pairs - gives you the ability to return multiple values (+ structured binding to create the pair for you)
