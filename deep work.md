### deep work vs. shallow work

- the supposed overall capacity for deep work per day is around ==4 hours==

- deep work is the work that moves us towards our goals - shallow work is typically things which we might have to physically be at and aren't as important

- treat the ability to focus ==like a muscle==
1. artificial deadlines
2. get rid of distractions

- chase the goals that are most meaningful

- embrace the satisfaction of deep work
