[[COMP23412]]

- similar to [[using external APIs]], external services aim to provide the right functionalities for whatever is being built, and the choice of service should aim to fit into whatever architecture is being built
- integration is a three-way conversation between:
	- the service provider
	- the service consumer
	- the user

### example - mastodon
- mastodonservice = consumer, while service provider = mastodon and user = view
