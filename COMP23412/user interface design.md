[[COMP23412]]

- Example: for the team coursework we're building a web app which can create, list, search and manage events which are happening in Manchester. This means the web app has the following requirements:
	- browse events by topic/keyword/venue
	- locate an event on a map

The ==functional requirements== are what we want the app to do. The ==non-functional requirements== are how we want the app to do certain things (security, performance)

User stories, persona stories and use cases are all examples of things which can be elaborated into scenarios and visual designs ahead of the implementation - by leaving out any specific details and just capturing the main idea, these can be useful to ==expose flaws== and misunderstandings

==The same functional requirements can end up in different designs==

When going from requirements to design, there are different ==fidelity levels== of visual designs which can help to refine a design, e.g.:
- sketches
- wireframes - typically used to arrange content (in a website for example)
- mockups - more advanced wireframes, more ui controls are added, and the mockup can actually be interacted with
- prototypes - the highest level of fidelity. Prototypes often have the exact same look as the real thing, but with hardcoded values for certain functions

For creating mockups in COMP23412 we use ==MockFlow== - there are many reasons for using mockups:
- Mockups simulate a dialogue with the customer
- Mockups save time

When creating mockups, you should ==extract the tasks from requirements==, and follow a ==top-bottom== approach
