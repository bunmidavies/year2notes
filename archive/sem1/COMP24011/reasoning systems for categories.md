- There are two main types of reasoning systems for categories

***
## Semantic Networks

- The graphical way to represent relations between categories
- Inferences can be made based on category membership

- Limitations include:
	- only being able to represent binary relations (n-ary assertions must be broken down)


***
## Description Logics

- A formal language used to construct category definitions
- Supports decising subset/superset relationships between categories

- Description Logics support operations on predicates (Unlike first order logic)
- Description logic also has a focus on the **tractability of inference** (being able to infer/solve problems within polynomial time)

- Limitations include:
	- Hard problems can't be stated at all, or require **large** descriptions
