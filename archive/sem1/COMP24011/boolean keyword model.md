==boolean keyword model==:
- each word in the corpus is a boolean feature
- 1 for document $d$ if the word appears in $d$ - 0 otherwise
- query is a boolean expression over features e.g. words `dog AND cat`
the ==drawback== of the boolean keyword model is that its difficult to present result sets in any particular order, i.e. order of ==relevance==
