- degrees of belief are a formal way to represent the strength with which one believes the truth of some proposition
- the higher the degree of belief, the higher the confidence in a proposition being true
- **all propositions have some degree of belief**

- the [[dutch book theorem]] exposes an irrational collection of degrees of belief - an agent has no choice but to accept each bet given their degrees of belief, but will lose in the end regardless

- given you learn that something, your degrees of belief should be updated. This is covered in [[updating degrees of belief]]
