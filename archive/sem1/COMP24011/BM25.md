[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011 

one of the most popular [[information retrieval]] formulas used today

==BM25== scoring is a linear weighted combination of scores for each word in the query

given document $d_j$ and a query with words $q_{1:N}$ (where $N$ is the no of words in the query)
$$BM25(d_j,q_{1:N}) = \sum_{i=1}^N IDF(q_i) \cdot \frac{TF(q_i,d_j) \cdot (k+1)}{TF(q_i,d_j)+k\cdot(1-b+b\cdot\frac{|d_j|}{L})}$$

- $N$ - no of documents in the corpus 
==NOTE that this is not the same N in the sum symbol - that N is the **no of words** in the query==
- $|d_j|$ - length of the document
- $L$ - average document length in corpus
- $k$ - parameter (typically $2.0$)
- $b$ - parameter (typically $0.75$)

$IDF$ formula used to measure the ==importance of a word==
(this uses the above definition of $N$ - no of docs in corpus):
$$IDF(q_i) = log\frac{N-DF(q_i) + 0.5}{DF(q_i) + 0.5}$$

there are ==3 main factors== in BM25:
- term frequency $TF$: how frequent the word appears in $d_j$
- inverse document frequency $IDF$: inverse of document frequency $DF$ (number of documents containing the word) - i.e. words with high document frequency will result in a lower IDF
- length of the document $|d_j|$
