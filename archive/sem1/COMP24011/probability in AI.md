[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011

- Chapter 13 [[r+n.pdf]] covers all + more of the background required for uncertainty / probability theory in AI

the video within COMP24011 is split into some sections:
- [[degrees of belief]] - an **agent** is designed to have some mechanism which aims to map according propositions to a degree of belief
- [[updating degrees of belief]] leads us on to [[Bayesian Updating]], which is demonstrated in a robot example in the lectures

probability theory isn't the only choice within AI - other alternatives include:
- depmpser-shafer theory
- [[fuzzy logic]]
- probability intervals
probability theory today though remains the popular vote by a landslide

- probability theory in AI may typically involve a lot of data, in order to store probability distributions etc.
- aim to cover more in [[pros and cons of probability theory]]
