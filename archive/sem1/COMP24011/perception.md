- perception allows agents to obtain information about the world
- e.g. **sensors** are how agents typically collect data, by interpreting responses from sensors accordingly, specifically visual sensors

- how agents make choices using perception can be split into 3 broad categories:
	- **feature detection/extraction** - computations applied to sensor readings
	- **recognition** - labelling images to distinguish between them
	- **reconstruction** - building a geometric model based on images
