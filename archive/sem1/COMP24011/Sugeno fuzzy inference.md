[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011 - [[Fuzzy Control]]

- Getting the truth values in the sugeno method is the same as [[Mamdami fuzzy inference]]
- The main difference is in getting the final crisp output - a weighted average function is used in order to determine this output, unlike mamdami which uses the centre of gravity method based off the output membership function
