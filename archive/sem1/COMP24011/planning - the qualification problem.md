[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011

- The qualification problem once again like [[planning - the frame problem]] will typically exist in environments which are more complex, and describes when certain difficulties in expressing the ==exact conditions required for an action to take place==

- With the blocks example in the COMP24011 videos, this isn't an issue, but as said thinking about it in real life, if a robot was involved in real life, much more possibilities exist (block being dropped, wobbling, robot not picking up block, block breaking, falling off table etc.)
