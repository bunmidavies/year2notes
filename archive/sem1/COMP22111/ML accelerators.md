[[COMP22111]]

as partially discussed within different notes, ML is more comput intensive than graphics, due to the number of calculations that need to be completed (neural networks are explained in [[Google TPU]])

==accelerators== only use essential components but maximise computing power

examples of accelerators include:
- [[GPUs]]
- [[FPGA]]s
- [[Google TPU]]
