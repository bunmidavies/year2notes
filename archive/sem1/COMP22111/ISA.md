an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is a functional contract, that serves as an interface between software and hardware of a system

it provides a standaradised description of a how a chip works at the most basic level, and instructions for writing software on it

a realisation of an ISA is called an implementation

the two main types of ISA are **RISC** and **CISC**, but **there are many other types** ([[RISC-V]], [[VLIW]], LIW, EPIC)

What makes a good ISA?
- enables high performance
- doesn't 'get in the way'
- compatability
- extra commands / functionalities
