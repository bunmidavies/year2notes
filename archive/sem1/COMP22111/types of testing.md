following on from [[verification vs testing]]

probe testing:
- the unpackaged chip is tested in order to save packaging expenses
- some specialist tools are required, making this process more expensive in terms of time and difficulty

packaged testing:
- easier to perform than probe testing
- however, discarding faulty chips is more expensive
- chips may also get damaged during packaging

[[test coverage]] explains the different areas of a design which are tested, and at which stages, and why this is important
