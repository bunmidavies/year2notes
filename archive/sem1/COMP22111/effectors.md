==effectors are used by robots to move and change the shape of their bodies==

a single ==degree of freedom== is counted as an indepedent direction which a robot can move in

example - ==the human elbow has two degrees of freedom== - it can flex the upper arm towards or away, and can rotate left or right

degrees of freedom can be ==controllable== or ==effective==
if ==number of controllable DoF == effective DoF==, the robot is ==holonomic==
if ==controllable DoF < effective DoF==, the robot is ==nonholonomic==
