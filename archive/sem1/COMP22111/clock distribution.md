the main goals of clock distribution are as follows:
- the clock should be phase-aligned with an external input clock
- skew should be 0 (or at least well characterized)
- jitter should be 0
- the set up time + data hold time should be 50/50 (or at least well characterized)

other goals of clock distribution include:
- the clock network should use a low amount of power
- the distribution should be simple to design and verify
- clock generation should support testing and debugging
