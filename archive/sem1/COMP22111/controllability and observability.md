There are two main factors concerned with making a system ==easy to test==

### controllability
- Making a circuit ==controllable== means making it easy to inject input patterns into the system
- Examples of implementing controllability include adding a multiplexer to take input patters from an easily programmed source

### observability
- The outputs of a device being visible is known as ==observability==
