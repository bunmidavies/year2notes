==Question 1==

*In the Stump processor we have a third state, Memory, for performing the memory access for Load/Store instructions. As we perform the instruction fetch (memory read) and PC update (using the ALU) in the fetch state, why canâ€™t we combine the ALU operation (address calculation) and memory access in the Execute state, thus removing the need for a third "memory" state?*
