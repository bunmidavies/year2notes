the [[CMOS]] circuits can be built up using pMOS and nMOS transistors

there are two main factors affecting the properties of a transistor:
- ==length==
- ==width==

length should always be as possible, while the width determines the ==drive strength== of the transistor

thus ==gate area is proportional to capacitive load==

power dissipation (i.e. power lost) is proportional to the total capacitance within these CMOS circuits - as total capacitance increases due to the wires and transistors, the possibility of ==circuit failure== due to ==overheating== increases

therefore, circuits should be designed to minimise the amount of power being dissipated

as well as this, as explained within [[voltage, current and resistance]], there will be a ==delay== between the signal changing and output actually changing
this means switching within circuits is ==not instantaneous==
