[[COMP22111]]

as part of [[voltage, current and resistance]], capacitors are used ==to store charge==

the ==parallel plate capacitor== is the simplest form of capacitor, which has two conducting plates separated by a non-conducting ==dielectric layer== e.g. air

due to the non-conducting layer, current cant flow through the capacitor. Instead it stores the charge

==capacitance== is measured in Farads, and is the ratio of charge stored to the voltage across the capacitor

capacitance in series and parallel is opposite to [[resistors]] - total capacitance is the reciprocal of the reciprocals of the individual capactiances in series. In parallel, the total capacitance is just the sum of capacitances

when a switch is closed on a circuit involving a source voltage and capacitor, as the voltage across the capacitor begins to increase, the flow of current begins to slow (voltage is the driving force of current), to the point where the ==voltage of capacitor = source voltage==, and current stops flowing

this is important because the [[MOSFET]] transistor acts like a switch - its gate terminal has a resistance *and* capacitance associated with it, affecting the speed at which this transistor operates
