there are a number of different views as to where probabilities can actually be obtained

==frequentists== believe that probabilities can only come from ==experiments==. E.g. if 100 people are tested and 10 of them have a cavity, then the probability of having a cavity $\approx$ 0.1 - in this view, 0.1 is the fraction that would be observed from infinitely many samples

the ==objectivist== view states that probabilities are real aspects of the universe - for instance, the probability of a coin flipping heads up is 0.5, and this is the natural behaviour of the coin, rather than a fraction of a sample like the frequentist view

the ==subjectivist== views a probability as an ==agent=='s belief. The subjective ==Bayesian== view allows using new information (evidence) in order to update an agent's belief about something
