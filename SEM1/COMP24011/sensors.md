==sensors== are a common piece of hardware within [[robots]]

sensors typically sense the robots ==environment==, ==location==, or ==internal configuration==

there are a number of different types of sensors within these 3 main types

#### passive sensors
examples include ==cameras==, which simply capture signals generated by other sources of the environment

#### active sensors
sensors which send energy into the environment, and rely on this energy being ==reflected== back to the sensor

#### range finders
sensors which find the distance to nearby objects, e.g. ==sonar sensors==

#### scanning lidars
==light detection and ranging== - uses laser beams and 1-pixel cameras, to provide longer ranges with better performance

#### tactile sensors
examples include whiskers, bump panels, touch-sensitive skin. Tactile sensors also measure ==range==, based on physical contact, designed for ranges very close to the robot

#### location sensors
the ==GPS== is the most common solution to localization problems, but can only be used outdoors

#### proprioceptive sensors
sensors which inform the robot of its own ==motion and internal config== - examples include ==shaft decoders== which count the revolution of motors of the robot

#### inertial sensors
examples include ==gyroscopes== - inertial sensors rely on the resistance of mass to the change of velocity

#### force sensors / torque sensors
==force sensors== are used to sense how hard a robot arm may be gripping an object, while a ==torque sensor== is used to sense how hard it is turning an object. These measurements are collected several hundreds of times per second, in order for a robot to quickly detect unexpected forces and correct its movement
