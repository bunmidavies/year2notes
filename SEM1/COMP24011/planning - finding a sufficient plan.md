- in order to be able to use first order logic theorem solvers with our goals, we can simply create a situation in logic where our goals are achieved
$$\sigma := \exists w(\textrm{goal achieved...})$$
- while trying to prove that $\Phi \models \sigma$, which we have established we'd like to do in [[planning with logic]], we will obtain a term representing a plan, or a **witness**
- from the witness we extract the plan
