==Robots are physical agents that perform tasks by manipulating the physical world==

robots have [[sem1/COMP24011/effectors]], which include legs, wheels, joints and grippers

robots also have [[sensors]], which allow for [[perception]] of their environment

there are 3 primary categories of robots:
- ==manipulators== - robot arms which are physically anchored to a workplace, e.g. ==assembly lines==
- ==mobile robot== - robots which move about their environment with wheels / legs. ==unmanned ground vehicles==, ==planetary rovers== and ==UAVs== are known examples
- ==mobile manipulators== - ==humanoid robots== are examples of a robot which has mobility combined with manipulation. Examples include prostethic limbs, intelligent environments

robotics brings together main of the previous topics within 24011

there are 3 types of ==motors== within robots:
- ==electric==
- ==pneumatic== - powered by compressed gas
- ==hydraulic== - powered by pressurised fluids
