inference tasks, or an ==inferential task== is a type of problem that involves using information to draw conclusions or make predictions about some aspect of the world

example: placing objects in a house, and moving throughout this house in order to place the objects

inference tasks can typically be represented with logic - inference rules are also known as ==syllogisms==

a ==sylligistic== is another word to describe a language involving syllogisms

atomic propositions which describe the current state of a problem are called ==fluents==

The syllogism rules can be used to formalise real life arguments which follow first order logic, and present things in a more compact manner
The negation of $\forall(p,q) = \exists(p,\bar{q})$.
If  $\forall(p,q)$ implies  $\exists(p,\bar{q})$, you can basically assume anything, because logic breaks down (?)
