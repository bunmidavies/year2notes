[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011

- Event calculus: representation of events/actions (fluents too) based on points of time
  $$T(At(Shankar,Berkeley),t)$$
  This represents that Shankar is at Berkeley, at time $t$
- Time can also be represented as a [[time interval]], e.g. $i = (t_1,t_2)$
  
- Events can also be placed into specific [[categories]]
- A number of predicates can be used to indicate certain things about an event

- Events and actions can be used interchangeably

- Processes i.e. liquid events - events that consist of **smaller events**

- **Mental events** are used to represent the knowledge of other agents - propositional attitudes for mental events include believing, knowing, wanting, intending
- [[Modal Logic]] is used to represent knowledge/beliefs. This differs to regular logic, which expresses that something is true
- A knows P vs. P is true
