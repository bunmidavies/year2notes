[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011

- A category is the most basic level used in reasoning. If you know if an [[object]] exists within a certain category, you can make certain assumptions based off this

- Representing a category in first order logic can be done with a predicate, or by turning the category into a set
	- Basketball(b)  
	- $b \in$ Basketballs

- Categories can exist within other categories, therefore making these **subcategories**

- There are different [[reasoning systems for categories]]

***
## taxonomies

- Taxonomy / Taxonomic hierarchy is where categories can be organised with some kind of hierarchy (i.e. basketballs are a subclass of Spherical objects)
- It also allows you to identify if an object belongs within a category, based off its attributes (i.e. orange, round, bounces $\rightarrow$ basketball)
- Atrributes/properties can also be inherited through a taxonomy (i.e. if all food is edible, and an apple is a subclass of food, apples must be edible too)

***
## relations between categories

- 2+ categories are disjoint if they have no common objects/members
- Exhaustive Decomposition = object needs to be in at least one of the given categories
- Partition = disjoint exhaustive decomposition (e.g. animal is in male or female)

***
## Physical composition

- part-of relations are a common example of showing how one object is part of another object
- e.g. PartOf(Bucharest, Romania) - The city Bucharest is part of Romania
- part-of relations are [[reflexive]] and [[transitive]]
