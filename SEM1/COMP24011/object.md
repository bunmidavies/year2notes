- Individuation: identifying distinct objects / things
- **Stuff**: objects that defy inviduation (e.g. some butter, some water)
- We represent stuff just like things
- Objects can have measurements, and these can be comparable
  $$b \in Butter \implies PartOf(p,b) \implies p \in Butter$$

## types of properties

- Intrinsic properties
	- Belong to the substance of the object, not the object as a whole
	- If you divided the stuff in half, intrinsic properties are retained
	- Example: Butter (melting point etc.)

- Extrinsic properties
	- Belong to that instance, and aren't retained after subdivision
	- Weight, length, shape etc. are extrinsic, as they aren't retained if you divided an object with these properties in half
	- Example: a car
