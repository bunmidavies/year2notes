- a partition for a propositions $\varphi_1,...\varphi_n$ means that they are both mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive - ==exactly 1 proposition is true==
- this means that 
  $p(\varphi_1) + ... + p(\varphi_n) = 1$

- **partition rule**, given $\psi$ (a different proposition to $\varphi$)
$p(\psi) = p(\psi|\varphi_1)\cdot p(\varphi_1) + ... + p(\psi|\varphi_n)\cdot p(\psi_n)$ = $\sum^n_{i=1} p (\psi|\varphi_i) \cdot p(\varphi_i)$

- this can be extended into the conditionalized parition rule
