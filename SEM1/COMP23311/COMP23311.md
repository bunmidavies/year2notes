```
You will not be expected to remember details of the code bases we work with in the coursework and in the workshops, but you may be asked about the concepts, tools and techniques we learnt about while working with them.  For example, you will not be required to answer questions about the details of how the Stendhal system works.  Nor will you be asked to write code that depends on your remembering anything about the Stendhal classes and their behaviour.  But you may be asked about the role of automated tests in ensuring that only good quality code is delivered to the customer, or about how the tools you used in the coursework (Git, issue trackers, continuous integration servers, etc.) help us to achieve this goal.  And you may be presented with small fragments of code from Stendhal or other code bases and asked questions about them, which you should answer based on your understanding of the key concepts and the information given in the code fragment, rather than from rote memory.
