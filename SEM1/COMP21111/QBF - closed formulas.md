- A QBF formula is called closed if it has no free variables ([[QBF - bound and free]])
- For every interpretation and closed QBF formula $F$ - if $I$ is a model of $F$, then $F$ is both **satisfiable** and **valid**
- This means that <span id="important">any closed formula is either true or false (in all interpretations)</span>
