==Resistors in series==
current flowing from the voltage source will flow through each resistor, so the current flowing through each is the same, so:
- ==total resistance = sum of all individual resistors added==

==Resistors in parallel==
when resistors are in parallel, the voltage across them is the same, but the ==current splits==. The reciprocal total resistance is the reciprocals of all resistance summed together
