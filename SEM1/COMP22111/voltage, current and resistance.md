[[COMP22111]]

if there is a ==conductive path== in a circuit, then ==electric charge== will flow

charge is measured in ==Coulombs==, and the continuous movement of charge is called ==Current==, measured in ==Amps==

==1A = 1 Coulomb per second==

to make current flow throughout the circuit, ==Voltage== is required, measured in volts. ==Voltage pushes the current around the circuit.== This means that with no voltage, there is no driving force, so ==no voltage = no current==

==Resistance== is measured in Ohms, and opposes the flow of current. [[resistors]]

Ohm's law states that ==voltage = current x resistance==
$$V = IR$$

==impedance== is a measure of how the circuit restricts the flow of current. It is different to resistance because it takes into account the effects of capacitance and circuit inductance. impendance is also measured in Ohms
