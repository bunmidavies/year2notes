**hardware emulation** - like FPGAs are common ways to simulate large logic subsystems without having to actually produce the real version intended to be developed

[[software simulation vs hardware emulation]] explains more about hardware vs software

there are two main types of simulation
***
### digital simulation
- verifies logic
- reveals instantiation problems
- no timing 
- quicker than analogue simulation
***

***
### analogue simulation
- verifies both timing and logic
- reveals edge speeds (i.e. time between signals changing)
- slower / more difficult to develop?
