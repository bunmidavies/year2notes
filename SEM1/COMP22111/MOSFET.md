MOSFETs are used within the vast majority of [[VLSI systems]] - MOSFET stands for ==Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor==

this name comes from earlier designs where layers of metal and semiconducting material was separated by an 'oxide' layer

==MOS== refers to any type of transistor with a metal-oxide layer, whereas ==MOSFET== specifically refers to the transistors with a metal-oxide layer to control the flow of current through the transistor
