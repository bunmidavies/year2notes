propagation delay is one of the delays that exist within flip-flops, in order to ensure that they operate correctly

The delays are as follows:
- input D must be stable before the clock edge for **set up time** (red)
- input D must be stable after the clock edge for **data hold time** (green)
- the flip flop Q changes state after the propagation delay time (blue)
