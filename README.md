# year2 bsc comp sci uom notes
- I'm maintaining my notes through git this year rather than onedrive since onedrive can just be a pain sometimes, and i've accidentally overwritten / lost data somehow too many times
- To do:
	- Navigation from this page as well as other pages
	- Markdown engine for latex etc because it's sometimes nice to read things within my browser / allows me to read my notes on my phone
	- Deadline list probably not even needed on here, but fat resource list needed
