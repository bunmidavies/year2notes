a discriminant function is a simple mapping function which maps ==an input to a class==

- discriminant functions are typically used for [[classification]]

- outputs can be converted to a class prediction simply by ==thresholding== - the example below shows binary classification involving two classes, A and B

- the set of input variables which give $f(x)=t$ is called the ==level set== of $f$
- the real number $t$ can be treated as a ==hyper-parameter==
- $t = 0$ is a common setting within discriminant functions
- a set of inputs which give $f(x) = t$ is called a ==level set== of $f$
