### ~ definition of machine learning
Tom M. Mitchell:
*"A machine learns with respect to a particular task T, performance metric P, and type of experience E, if the system reliably imrpoves its performance P at task T, following experience E."*

Examples of ==tasks== include:
- predicting future events
- automating processes
- decision making
- pattern discovery / extracting knowledge from data

Machine Learning is ==not about writing code to do these tasks== - machine learning is writing code for a ==computer to learn from data, on how to do these tasks==

For this reason, machine learning plays a significant role in ==Artificial Intelligence==. Examples include:
- Speech recognition / NLP
- Computer vision
- Text mining
- Robotics

Machine Learning also plays a key point in data science - with huge amounts of data, machine learning algorithms can become better at creating predictions and analysing data than humans ever can be

### ~ key historical events in machine learning
[wikipedia - timeline of machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_machine_learning)

- 1940s: human reasoning / logic first studied as a formal subject within maths (the general ==start of ML==)
- 1950s: the [[Turing Test]] is proposed
- 1956: the term ==Artifical Intelligence== is coined by Dartmouth
- 1959: Arthur Samuel writes a program that learns to play checkers
- 1960s: AI funding increased (mainly military)
- 1970s: AI 'winter' - a lot of funding dries up as people realise its difficult
- 1980s: revival of AI through bio-inspired algorithms (neural networks, genetic algorithms)
- 1990s: AI diverges into separate fields - ML, computer vision, automated reasoning, NLP
- 2000s: ML merging with statistics continues, and other subfields continue in parallel
- 2010s: Deep neural networks start to lead to significant improvement in speech recognition, reinforcement learning, image classification etc

the 3 'fathers' of deep learning: Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun received the Turing Award for their contribution to the development of deep neural networks
