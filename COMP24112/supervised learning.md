[[COMP24112]]

Wiki definition:
*"The machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs"*

- the ==based on example input-output pairs== is basically what distinguishes supervised learning from [[unsupervised learning]]

- A ==teacher== provides the expected output for each data pattern/input
- These pairs of input to expected output are called ==pairs==
- Supervised learning tasks include [[classification]] and [[regression]], the two of which differ based on their output type

examples of supervised learning applications include:
- Speech recognition
- Facial recognition
- Object recognition
