### definition
- deep learning refers to techniques used for learning using ==neural networks== ([[artificial neural networks]])
- the main difference between deep learning and regular machine learning experiments is that ==simple features== are firstly extracted into their own layer for deep learning, and an additional layer of ==abstract features== is also included
- in a traditional ML strategy, features are extracted, then refined and passed into a prediction model
- in a deep learning strategy, features are passed into a ==neural network==, and this new high quality feature representation is passed into a prediction model

### end-to-end systems
- as mentioned above, the neural network is also known as a ==representation generator==, and provides the inputs to a prediction model as a set of high quality features
- the combination of this representation generator and predictor is an ==end-to-end system==
