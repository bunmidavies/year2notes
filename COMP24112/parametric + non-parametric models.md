[[COMP24112]]

- a ==parametric model== is a model which has parameters to be optimised
- a ==non-parametric model== has no parameters which are to be optimised - the most common example of this is [[k nearest neighbour (k-NN)]]

- all model parameters are 1 of 2 things:
	1. optimisable
	2. hyper-parameters (to be selected)
