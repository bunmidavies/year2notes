- normal equations are used for solving linear systems when trying to reach the [[optimality condition]] for parameters in a given ML model
- we aim to solve the equation where the ==gradient of the error function is equal to 0==

- we take the formula at the top and set it to 0, and can rearrange it to obtain the ==normal equation== for the least squares problem

### multi-output
- the same idea basically applies to multi-output - read [[linear least squares]] to see where the multi-output equation is from
