Wiki definition:
*"Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from ==untagged data=="*

- unlike [[supervised learning]], ==there is no teacher==
- an ML system using unsupervised learning forms a ==natural understanding== based on a hidden structure within the unlabelled data

- typical unsupervised learning tasks include:
	- ==clustering==: grouping similar data patterns together
	- ==generative modelling==: estimating the distribution of observed patterns
	- ==unsupervised representation learning==: removing noise, capturing inherent data structures

Examples of applications include:
- Document clustering/visualisation
