# machine learning

[[ML chapter summaries]]
[[COMP24112Maths.pdf]]

#### Lab Advice
- Submit one jupyter file, and one pdf report
- Strictly follow requirements on allowed libraries

### Exam
- distance calculation will show up in the exam ([[distance measuring for k-NN]])

each week corresponds to a chapter
