# machine learning

[[ML chapter summaries]]
[[COMP24112Maths.pdf]]

#### Lab Advice
- Submit one jupyter file, and one pdf report
- Strictly follow requirements on allowed libraries

### Exam
- distance calculation will show up in the exam ([[distance measuring for k-NN]])

each week corresponds to a chapter

### week 1 
[[what is machine learning + history of machine learning]]
[[machine learning strategies]]
[[ML optimisation]]
[[machine learning pipeline]]

[[supervised learning]]
[[unsupervised learning]]
[[reinforcement learning]]

[[classification]]
[[regression]]

[[typical machine learning tasks]]

### week 2
[[k nearest neighbour (k-NN)]]
[[instance based learning]] being the base idea of k-NN

[[distance measuring for k-NN]]
[[effect of training samples for k-NN]]
[[effect of neighbour number for k-NN]]
[[neighbour searching algorithms]]

### week 3 - ==machine learning experiments==
