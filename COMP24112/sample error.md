A hypothesis is a prediction made by a trained machine learning model

The sample error of a hypothesis is known as $\textrm{error}_s$
It is the ==error computed by a performance metric using a set of data samples==

==We can always compute the sample error==, which is what makes it an alternative to [[true error]] which can be very difficult to compute, or in some cases not possible to compute at all

- Infinite samples: samples converge to a true error
- Insufficient samples: sample error may not approximate to the true error well
