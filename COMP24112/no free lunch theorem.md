### definition
- the no free lunch theorem was introduced by David Wolpert and William Macready in 1997 - the main idea is that ==on average, no ML algorithm performs better than another when averaged across all problems==
- essentially, there is no context-free/problem-independent reason to pick one method over another
- what ==always== must be taken into account is:
	- the task/problem at hand
	- how different machine learning models perform with the task/problem
- no method can be expected to be superior or inferior to another if no assumptions are made about the task
