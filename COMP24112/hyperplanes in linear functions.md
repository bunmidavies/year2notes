### ~ defintion
by setting a linear function equal to zero, a hyperplane is created, which causes separation within the function:
- in a 2D space, a linear function equalling to 0 results in a straight line
- meanwhile in a 3D space, a linear function equalling to 0 results in a plane
- the distance from an arbitrary point to the plane can also be calculated

- the distance from the origin to the plane can also be easily calculated - $b$ is just the ==bias== which is used in the linear model

### creating parallel hyperplanes
- parallel hyperplanes can be created by taking the original lienar function, and instead of making it equal to 0, making it equal to 1 or -1
- the distance between these 2 newly created planes can also be calculated
