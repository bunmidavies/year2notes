[[COMP24112]] - related to [[linear models]]

by setting a linear function equal to zero, a hyperplane is created, which causes separation within the function:
- in a 2D space, a linear function equalling to 0 results in a straight line
- meanwhile in a 3D space, a linear function equalling to 0 results in a plane
