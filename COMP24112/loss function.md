[[COMP24112]]

### definition
- the loss function is typically represented as $O$, and is also known as:
	- error function
	- objective function
	- cost function
- the loss function decides how good a models ==parameters== are, and how well the model fits your training data provided
- the loss function is essential in ML training, and is computed using training data
- to train an ML model, you pick a loss function, then either:
	- minimise it if the function evaluates how bad a model is
	- maximise it if the function evaluates how good a model is
