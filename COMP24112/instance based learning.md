[[COMP24112]]

all instance based learning algorithms follow the same idea of trying to ==predict output== based on the similarity/distance of the query to its nearest neighbours in the training set

the representative algorithm for this is [[k nearest neighbour (k-NN)]]

the main aspects to be considered in an instance based learning problem:
- how to compute the distance
- how to choose k
- how to infer the output from neighbouring points
