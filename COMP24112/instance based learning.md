### ~ definition
- instance based learning is a machine learning approach
- it involves comparing new problems with ==stored instances== i.e. training instances, and finding where this problem lies within the existing 'instance space'
- the representative algorithm for this is [[k nearest neighbour (k-NN)]]
- the main aspects to be considered in an instance based learning problem:
	1. how to compute the distance
	2. how to choose $k$
	3. how to infer the output from neighbouring points
