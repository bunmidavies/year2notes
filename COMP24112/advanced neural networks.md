### CNNs
- a ==convolutional neural network== is used to automatically learn how to create a good feature vector for an image, based on the pixels provided
- examples include [NeuralStyle]() and [DeepDream]()

### RNNs
- ==recurrent neural networks== are particularly useful for learning from sequential data
- each neuron has internal memory to retain info about the previous input - this makes RNNs useful for processing natural languages, speech, music, etc
- ==LSTMs== (long short-term memory) networks and ==gated recurrent units== are two of the most popular types of RNN
