The goal of classification is to figure out which ==category== a data pattern belongs to

This means the training data provided to classification algorithms consist of observed data patterns and ==which category they belong to==

There are multiple types of classification:
- Binary: all data patterns belong to ==one of two classes==
- Multi-class: all data patterns belong to one of ==many classes==
- Multi-label: all data patterns can belong to ==some of many classes==
- Structured classification: data can be classified into ==structured== classes
