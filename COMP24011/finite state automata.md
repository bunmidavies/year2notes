finite state automata define ==patterns== to extract ==attributes== from some piece of text / document. ==Regular expressions== is a common way of representing finite state automata

to extract relations between multiple attributes, ==cascaded finite-state transducers== can be used

finite state automata are normally used for [[information extraction]] in natural language processing
