==perfect information== refers to a situation where all relevant information is known and available to all players within a game ([[adversarial search]] problems)

example: in a game of chess, both players can see the entire board (i.e. the ==state of the game==)

in real life, most situations don't possess perfect information, so AI algorithms usually have to make decisions based off incomplete information
