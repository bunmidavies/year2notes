[[COMP24011]] / #comp24011 - [[Fuzzy Control]]

- A linguistic variable is an input or output variable in a fuzzy control system, where its values are natural-language words, rather than numerical values
- Example:
	- $T(service\_quality) = {poor,good,excellent}$
	- $T(food) = {rancid,okay,excellent}$

- These are the crisp inputs to be provided to a fuzzy control system
