- An ontology, defined by Thomas Gruber is:
"Every ontology is a treaty - a social agreement - among people with some common motive in sharing"

- Therefore there is no ultimate common ontology, because the use of any given ontology will be different depending ont the person

- AI applications use special-purpose ontologies, which can be created by:
	- Trained ontologists/logicians
	- Importing categories from existing databases (DBPedia)
	- Extracting info from textual documents
	- Open source resources (OpenMind)

- Ontologies are made up of different [[categories]]
