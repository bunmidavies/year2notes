language models are useful within [[knowledge acquisition]]

firstly, the definition of a ==language==:
- languages have an infinite number of allowed strings
- languages have a set of rules known as a ==grammar==

within ==natural languages==, this grammar does not specify a ==definitive== set. this means that its debatable as to whether certain strings may be part of a natural language's grammar

natural languages are also ==ambiguous==. The same sentence could mean multiple things. This is why ==probability distributions== are useful in language models

for this reason, as well as natural languages being continuously changing and large, language models are just ==approximations==

language models covered:
- [[n-gram character models]]
- [[n-gram word models]]
