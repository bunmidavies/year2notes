### ~ intro
- in order for SDRAM to operate correctly, control lines and other signal timing needs to be handled correctly
- things such as ==skew== need to be avoided, or more realistically minimised, in order to retain data integrity
- the SDRAM controller will typically have to resynchronise signals as well
