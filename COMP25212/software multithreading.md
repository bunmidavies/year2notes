### ~ definition
- software multithreading basically involves the operating system supporting multiple processes/threads - this is also known as ==multitasking==
- to the user, these processes will appear to be running at the same time, but in reality they are ==scheduled by the OS==
- the operating system's involvement is the main differentiator between software multithreading and [[hardware multithreading]] - hardware multithreading is built into the processor and does not require any software support in order for multiple threads to be run simultaneously
