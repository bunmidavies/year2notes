CAM is ==Content Addressable Memory==, but also known as ==associative memory==

CAM is not directly part of main memory hierarchy - its a component it may be used in different architectural elements such as:
- highly associative caches
- packet routing lookup (in networks)
- AI/ML acceleration

in RAM, an address goes in, and data comes out- this is basically the ==opposite== to CAM where data goes in, and an address comes out (more or less)
