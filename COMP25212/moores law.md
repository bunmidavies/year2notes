[[COMP25212]]

### ~ definition
- ==the number of transistors on an IC doubles every 2 years=

smaller transistors = more transistors + faster transistors
although smaller transistors result in lower energy use per component, more components still results in power management being the limiting factor in many systems

power consumption / dissipation matters for two main reasons:
- high power shortens battery life
- high power consumption causes cooling problems

more transistors = opportunities for more complexity

### ~ limits of moore's law
- speed of light
- power dissipation
- price / affordability
