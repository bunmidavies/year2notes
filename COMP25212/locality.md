locality is a useful properties for [[caches]]

there are two main types of locality:
- Spacial locality - if a certain address was accessed, things nearby will probably be accessed as well
- Temporal locality - if an address was used once, it will probably be used again shortly

being able to exploit locality is under some statistical assumptions - the computer should be performing normal tasks i.e. supercomputers which operate on a lot of data are probably not as able to exploit locality
