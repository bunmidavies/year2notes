[[COMP25212]]

### ~ definition
A balanced computer should have:
- 1 MIPS processing (1 million instructions per second)
per
- 1MB memory (1 megabyte)
per
- 1Mb/s I/O (1 megabit)

- there is no point of having any of these without the other, since you'll run into bottlenecks if one of the three doesn't exist

### ~ the memory wall
- Memory speed increases by around ==7% per year==
- Processor speed has increased by around ==60% per year==
- this means memories have become up to 10x faster, while processors have become over 1000x faster - the disparity in these speeds is the ==memory wall==

==*in short, memory is increasing, but not at the same pace as processors*==
