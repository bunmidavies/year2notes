### definition
- power dissipation within a processor depends on:
	- clock rate
	- capacitive load
	- voltage
$$\textrm{power} = \textrm{capacitive load} \times \textrm{voltage}^2 \times \textrm{frequency}$$
- therefore increasing any of these increases power dissipation
- decreasing voltage reduces power consumption, but increases static ==power leakage== from transistors
- transistor shrinking is also contributing to power leakage
- the practical ==power limit for cooling commodity microprocessors== has been reached - clock rate can no longer be increased without burning the device or infeasibly expensive cooling
- this rule is more constrained for portable devices

*as the size is decreasing in nm, the leakage increases causing a number of concerns, including health concerns*
