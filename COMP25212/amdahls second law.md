[[COMP25212]]

A balanced computer should have:
- 1 MIPS processing
per
- 1MB memory
per
- 1Mb/s I/O

There is no point of having these without the other, since you'll run into bottlenecks if one of the three doesn't exist

- Memory speed increases by around ==7% per year==
- Processor speed has increased by around ==60% per year==

This means memories have become up to 10x faster, while processors have become over 1000x faster - the disparity in these speeds is the ==memory wall==

*memory is increasing, but not at the same pace as processors*
