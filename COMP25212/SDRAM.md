- SDRAM is the ==modern way to interface DRAM== - it is a form of DRAM which uses a clocked wrapper in order to making timing/interfacing easier
- hence the S in SDRAM standing for ==synchronous== - SDRAM provides high bandwidth burst access, but can still have long latency and scheduling issues
- like DRAM, SDRAM can also have multiple banks - which mainly operate independently
