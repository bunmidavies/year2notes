processors were mainly covered in previous modules, meanwhile COMP25212 covers ==buses== and ==memory== (with some more on processors)

## 2nd half notes

### week 6 - pipelining
- revision of 3-box architecture (COMP15111) - processor, memory and buses
- revision of types of instructions - memory operations, processing operations and control flow instructions
- [[fetch-execute]] details, and [[cycles of operation + stages]]
- [[pipelining]], [[control hazards]] and how they can be mitigated with [[branch prediction]]
- [[data hazards]]
