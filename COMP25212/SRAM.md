SRAM = static ram. Genuinely randomly accessible

- quite compact
- low power (especially when not in use)
- volatile - retains data (only) whilst powered

SRAM has multiple applications:
- working RAM in small processor systems (microcontrollers)
- cache memories in big processor systems
- buffer memories in interfaces (e.g. USB, ethernet)
- temporary storage in hardware FSMs
