[[COMP25212]]

- set associative caches are a compromise solution between full [[associativity]] and direct mapped caches

- the idea is to have two direct mapped caches in parallel - this offers two possibles places where any piece of data may be cached, and this prevents some conflicts that would occur in a direct mapped cache
