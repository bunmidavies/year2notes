	  Common data structures that hold data - fully encapsulated, all memory allocations are handled
	- **[[Iterators + Ranges]]**
	  Abstracts certain processes involving accessing containers 
	- **Algorithms**
	  Applied to iterators and ranges, to find certain elements or apply user defined functions to each element
	- **Functions**
