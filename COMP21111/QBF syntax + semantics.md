- quantified boolean formulas extend [[propositional formula]]
- **example**: in a 2 player game, with players $P$ and $Q$, where $P$ aims to make formula $G$ true, and $Q$ aims to make formula $G$ false, we say that $P$ has a winning strategy if:
	- There exists a move for $P$ such that:
	- For all moves of $Q$:
	- There exists a move $P$ such that:
	- For all moves of $Q$
	- ...
	- For all moves of $Q$, formula $G$ becomes true
- i.e. $\exists p_1 \forall q_1 \exists p_2 \forall q_2 ... \exists p_n \forall q_n G$

### Syntax

- Definition:
	- If $p$ is a boolean variable and $F$ is a formula, then $\forall pF$ and $\exists pF$ are formulas
	- Existentially quantified = $\exists$
	- Universally quantified = $\forall$

### Semantics

- refer to [[variable assignment definition]] for understanding on the $I^b_p(q)$ notation
- Extended semantics:
	- $I(\forall pF) = 1$ if and only if $I^0_p(F) = 1$ and $I^1_p(F) = 1$
	- $I(\exists pF) = 1$ if and only if $I^0_p(F) = 1$ or $I^1_p(F) = 1$

- Interpretation trees can typically be used to evaluate QBF formulas under any interpretation, e.g. from video_25

- Extended subformulas + position and polarity
	- The formula $F_1$ is the immediate subformula of the formulas $\forall pF_1$ and $\exists pF_1$
	- Quantifiers are like unary connectives. Subformulas with quantifiers have the same polarity as the parent (is parent the right word?) formulas
- Quantifiers cause variables to be **bound** - [[QBF - bound and free]] - this means that the value of the formula doesn't depend on the values of the variables within any given interpretation

- note that [[equivalent replacement]] holds for QBFs as well as propositional formulas

- Given a formula $F$ with propositional variables $p_1,...,p_n$, we can represent it as $F(p_1,...,p_n)$
- Therefore, we can say that
i) $F(p_1,...,p_n)$ is satisfiable iff $\exists p_1 ... \exists p_n F(p_1,...,p_n)$ is true
ii) $F(p_1,...,p_n)$ is valid iff $\forall p_1 ... \forall p_n F(p_1,...,p_n)$ is true

- Algorithms like splitting and DPLL for QBFs will check whether a closed formula is true or false ([[QBF - bound and free]]):
