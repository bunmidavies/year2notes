[[COMP21111]]

- a rectified formula $F$
	- has no variable which appears both free and quantified in $F$
	- for every variable $p$, $F$ contains at most one occurence of a quantifier of $p$

- **jointly rectified formulas** $(F_1,...,F_n)$:
	- if $p$ occurs free in one of $F_i$ then $p$ doesnt occur bound in $F_1,...F_n$
	- theres at most one occurence of quantifiers of $p$ in $F_1,...,F_n$
- where $p$ is every variable in each formula
