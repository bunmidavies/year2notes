- prenex formulas take the form $\exists\forall_1p_1 ... \exists\forall_np_n G$, where $G$ is quantifier free (i.e. just a propositional formula)
- **all QBFs can be converted to prenex form**

**prenexing rules**
- prenexing ONLY works if the formula is rectified before application of prenex form ([[QBF - rectification]])

- **prenexing example**

prenexing can be applied non deterministically - the example below is the same starting formula, and shows the rules being applied in a different order

these formulas are different, but are **both** semantically equivalent
