$$I^b_p(q) = \begin{cases}I(q) & \textrm{if } p \neq q;  
\\ b & \textrm{if } p = q;
\end{cases}$$
- $I(q)$ = value of boolean variable $q$ for interpretation $I$
- $b$ = boolean value to be assigned
- $p$ = variable to assign $b$ to
- $I(q)$ if $p \neq q$ - the value of $q$ ($I(q)$) remains as it was if $q$ isn't the boolean variable we want
- $b$ if $p = q$ - if $q$ is the variable we want, $I(q)$ now = $b$, the value we wanted to newly assign
