- The Turing test was originally called the ==imitation game== by Alan Turing in 1950
- It is *'a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.*
- A human should be able to judge natural conversations it has between another human and a robot, and be able to distinguish which is which
- The Turing Test was first introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", while working at UoM

It opens with the words: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" Because "thinking" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words." Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the "imitation game", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that "machines can think".
