in amortized analysis, we ==average== the time required to perform a sequence of ==data-structure operations== over ==all operations performed== within some algorithm

amortized analysis differs from average case analysis because ==probability is NOT involved== - amortized analysis guarantees the ==average performance== of each operation on a data structure in the ==worst case==

there are 3 main methods for amortized analysis:
- [[aggregate method]]
- ==accounting method==
- ==potential method==
