The pertrubation method involves finding the ==first term== of a recurrence relation, then taking its ==last term==, and finding $S_n$ on its own using these terms

Both the first and last terms should be found from $S_{n+1}$

the pertrubation method works effectively for sums ==containing exponentials==
