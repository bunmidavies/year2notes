==example runthrough==

![[Pasted image 20230126170954.png]]
`a[j] > key` therefore we make `a[j+1] = a[j]`
![[Pasted image 20230126171001.png]]
afterwards, we decrement j and make `a[j+1] = key`
i is incremented because this is a for loop
running through the next iteration, we make `key = a[i]` where `i` now equals `3`
![[Pasted image 20230126171256.png]]
the condition `a[j] > key` isnt met, therefore we dont go through the while loop
i now becomes 4, and key becomes a[i] i.e. 20
![[Pasted image 20230126171435.png]]
the while loop condition is met again, so 20 gets swapped with 40
20 will then get swapped with 30 as well, and the key gets reinserted

list is sorted!

***
### conditions
- `preconditions` of the sort: at least 2 elements
- ==how many times does the while loop run?== - $n - 1$. This is because the for loop begins with $i = 2$
- `postconditions` of the sort: list is in sorted order

therefore we can define the following terms:
- invariant: `A[1..i-1]` consists of elements originally in `A[1..i-1]`, but in sorted order
- termination condition: when `i == n+1` (video uses 1-based indexes in the array)

### cost of program in terms of effort
![[Pasted image 20230126172049.png]]
for each instruction, we consider it to have some set amount of time to be executed. This means, we assign a constant $c$ to each line of code - we do not need to break this down into assembly or even consider what this constant might be at this time, but we need to be ==aware== of this

we define $T$ as the ==total number of while loop executions== across each and every outer loop. I.e.
$$T = t_2 + t_3 + ... + t_n$$
where $t_i$ is the $i$'th for loop iteration

therefore, we can sum the total time for this program

what are the potential case scenarios which affect this sum?

### ==best case time calculation==
$T = t_2 + t_3 + ... + t_n$
![[Pasted image 20230126172924.png]]
each of the times are a constant 1, so you get $n - 1$ 1's since you start from $i = 2$

now we know $T(n) = c_1n + ... + c_7(n-1)$ previously, but now we can remove any mention of $T$ with $n-1$, and simplify the equation
$$T(n) = c_1n + c_2(n-1) + c_3(n-1) + c_4T + c_5(T-(n-1)) + c_6(T-(n-1)) + c_7(n-1)$$
$$T(n) = c_1n + c_2(n-1) + c_3(n-1) + c_4(n-1) + c_7(n-1)$$
$$T(n) = (c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 + c_7)\cdot n - (c_2 + c_3 + c_4 + c_7)$$
$$T(n) = c_1n - c_2$$
$$T(n) = O(n)$$

### ==worst case time calculation==
so for the best case we know that the while loops are going to be executed for all possible loops

(assuming we wont have to do some shit like this in the exam but who knows)
![[Pasted image 20230126173617.png]]

by mashing all the sums involving constants into singular constants, we obtain:
$$T(n) = an^2 + bn - c$$
therefore
$$T(n) = O(n^2)$$

### average case ???
- this is not the focus of COMP26120
