[[COMP26120]]

in the module there are 5 main types of computational problems:
1. decision problem - yes/no answer
2. function problem - finding a unique solution
3. search problem - finding a unique solution from a feasible set
4. counting problem - finding the number of solutions in a feasible set
5. optimisation problem - finding the "best" solutiopn from a feasible set
