### ~ definition
- a one-way function is a function which is ==easy to compute==, but ==hard to invert==
- formally, we can say that a one-way function can be computed in polynomial time, but any polynomial time randomised algorithm which attempts to compute a pseudo-inverse of this function succeeds with ==negligible probability==
- in short, it is ==hard== in the average case to find the inverse of the function
