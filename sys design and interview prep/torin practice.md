- with one transaction, the problem is quite simple

- **spend more time** clarifications = 2 mins (needs to take longer)
- e.g. cars / traffic - is this a dashboard or app for people to use
- setting up endgoals
- minimise steps when estimating
- go back to clarifications at the end
- estimations = 10 mins
- clarify data 
- dont just write down *SQL*/*NoSQL* - **stray away from instinct** (weigh up tradeoffs)
- timeseries database ()
- always reflect
- define tables when asked about SQL
- always start top down with system design
- mention horizontal / vertical scaling

- wrap up - look at clarifications, bottlenecks, **weigh up the decision**
- say that you DONT KNOW
